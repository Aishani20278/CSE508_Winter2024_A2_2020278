       " 2: \"We use these for everything from our acoustic bass down to our ukuleles. I know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.\\n\\nThe greatest benefit has been when writing music at the computer and needing to set a guitar down to use the keyboard/mouse - just easier for me than a hanging stand.\\n\\nWe have several and gave one to a friend for Christmas as well. I've used mine on stage, and it folds up small enough to fit right in my gig bag.\",\n",

       " 4: \"I bought this bass to split time as my primary bass with my Dean Edge. This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy.\",\n",

I tried adding additional Velcro, but that didn't stop it.  But now, with the Pearl Pedal Stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.  The Pearl's long spikes go deep into my old oriental carpet that I use as my drum rug at a perfect angle to restrict any forward movement.  Now I can really kick it hard!

The AC plug that goes into the wall or power strip is not designed for standard outlets found in the United States.  While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.

The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn\\'t seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.

As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.\",\n",

Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\",\n",

       " 341: \"Guys, this is a really good sounding pedal.  It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\",\n",

Only problem I had is that I had previously installed a set of Dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new Fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. So I had to use the previous Dunlop screws with the new Fender ones, and it worked like a charm. Not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later.

Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.

So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.

      "Review:  Looking at these on a guitar when they don't have a single wrap on the post, I found it hard to believe the strings would even stay on but I have now installed two sets of these on two different guitars. One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\n",
      "I have added a few pictures. The new tuners covered the holes on my Les Paul so it looks great from the back. The Other is an Ibanez AR420. You can see the original mounting holes so I filled them with wood putty and will use model car paint to match to cover the spots.\n",

It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.\n",

      "Review:  Looking at these on a guitar when they don't have a single wrap on the post, I found it hard to believe the strings would even stay on but I have now installed two sets of these on two different guitars. One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\n",
      "I have added a few pictures. The new tuners covered the holes on my Les Paul so it looks great from the back. The Other is an Ibanez AR420. You can see the original mounting holes so I filled them with wood putty and will use model car paint to match to cover the spots.\n",

      "Review:  I really like the simplicity of this bridge. It adjusts easy for string height and length. It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.\n",
